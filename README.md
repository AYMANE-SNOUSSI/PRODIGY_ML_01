# Task 01 - Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

In this project, we trained a linear regression model to predict house prices using three main features: 
- Lot area (`LotArea`)
- Number of full bathrooms (`FullBath`)
- Number of bedrooms above ground (`BedroomAbvGr`)

After training, we evaluated the model and achieved an \( R^2 \) score of 37.01%, which indicates that the model partially explains the variance in house prices. Future improvements could include adding more features and exploring more complex models.
